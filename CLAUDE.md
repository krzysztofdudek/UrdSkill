# UrdSkill

## Purpose

This repository exists solely so the author can develop and version the urd skill. The canonical file is `skills/urd/SKILL.md` — people install it as a Claude Code plugin (or copy that one file into their agent's skill dir). Nothing in this repo (CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, CI, etc.) may affect the skill's mechanics. All behavior must be self-contained in `skills/urd/SKILL.md`.

Urd (formerly "BePrecise") is an add-on in the Yggdrasil family: it attaches to the agent, not to the graph, and works alone. It owns the **intent → code** stage — when the agent moves from a plan/spec into implementation, it consults the source of truth and asks instead of guessing. The family's core is Yggdrasil (the law: the architecture graph and the rails), Grain (surveys the terrain: the first graph, mined from a repository's own code and history) and Horde (the software house on the law: zero standing roles, a worker per ticket and a one-shot architect); adoption runs Grain first, day zero, then Yggdrasil as the long-term core; once the work needs more hands than one agent, there are two doors, Horde for a mission held to Yggdrasil's law and Jarl, the lighter one beside it, with no law and no landing gate. Ratatoskr, Urd, Researcher and Jarl are the four add-ons beside the core, each with no dependency of its own.

## Plugin scaffolding

This repo is installable as a Claude Code plugin and as a GitHub Copilot CLI plugin. Layout:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest (name, version, description, keywords). `version` here MUST match the latest released version in `CHANGELOG.md` and is bumped together with it.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — single-plugin marketplace listing for Claude Code, so the repo can be added via `/plugin install urd@urd-marketplace`.
- `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` — single-plugin marketplace listing for GitHub Copilot CLI (Copilot reads this path), so the repo can be added via `copilot plugin marketplace add krzysztofdudek/UrdSkill` then `copilot plugin install urd@urd-marketplace`. Mirrors the Claude listing but additionally carries `version` and a `skills` array (`./skills/urd`). Its plugin `version` MUST be kept in lockstep with `plugin.json`.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest for OpenAI Codex CLI (Codex reads the plugin manifest only from `.codex-plugin/`). Bundles the skill via `"skills": "./skills/"`; Codex discovers the marketplace from the existing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (its legacy-compatible path), so the repo installs via `codex plugin marketplace add krzysztofdudek/UrdSkill` then `codex plugin install urd@urd-marketplace`. Its `version` MUST be kept in lockstep with `plugin.json`.
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest for Cursor (single-plugin-at-root: manifest at the repo root, no Cursor marketplace file; components are auto-discovered, so `skills/urd/` is picked up automatically). Installed locally via `~/.cursor/plugins/local/` or published to the Cursor Marketplace. Its `version` MUST be kept in lockstep with `plugin.json`.
- `skills/urd/SKILL.md` — the canonical skill body. Editing this file IS editing the skill.

When bumping version, update the `version` in all of `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` (plugin entry), `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` in lockstep with the CHANGELOG section header.

## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and maintains a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

When the user says "bump version":
1. Move `[Unreleased]` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` into a new version section with today's date
2. Update the comparison links at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md` (add the new `[X.Y.Z]: …compare/vA.B.C...vX.Y.Z` line and point `[Unreleased]` at the new version)
3. Update the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` (plugin entry), `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` to match
4. Commit the bump and push to `main` — that's it.

Do not create or push tags manually. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow runs on every push to `main`, reads the top version from `CHANGELOG.md`, and if `v<version>` does not already exist it creates the tag, pushes it, and publishes a GitHub Release with notes extracted from the matching changelog section.
